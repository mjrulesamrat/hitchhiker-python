# All together
So far we have learned about:
- **Variables**, which store values for later use
- **Data types**, such as numbers and booleans
- **Whitespace**, which separates statements
- **Comments**, which make your code easier to read
- **Arithmetic operations**, including `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `**`, and `%`

## Let's put our knowledge to work
Create a file with .py extension and
- Write a single-line comment on line 1. It can be anything! (Make sure it starts with `#`)
- Set the variable `monty` equal to `True`.
- Set another variable `python` equal to `1.234`.
- Set a third variable `monty_python` equal to `python` squared.
