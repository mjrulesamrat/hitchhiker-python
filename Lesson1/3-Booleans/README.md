# Lesson 1 / Booleans

## Tasks
- Learning how to create varaible in Python

## Get Started
The next data type is boolean which is like a light switch. It can only have two values. Just like a light switch can only be on or off, a boolean can only be `True` or `False`.

1. Create a file `variables.py` with the following content
```py
my_table_lamp = True

print my_table_lamp
```
2. In the terminal run the following command
```shell
python variables.py
```
3. You must see `True` printed in the terminal.  

Great! You just stored a boolean in a variable. **Booleans** are one data type we use in programming.
