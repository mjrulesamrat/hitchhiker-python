# Lesson 1 / Variables

## Taks
- Learning how to create varaible in Python

## Get Started
Creating web apps, backend services, games, search engines, etc. all involves interacting with different types of data. This is possible using **variables**. A **variable** stores a piece of data and gives it a specific name.

1. Create a file `variables.py` with the following content
```py
my_variable = 20

print my_variable
```
2. In the terminal run the following command
```shell
python variables.py
```
3. You must see `20` printed in the terminal.  

Great! You just stored a number in a variable. **Numbers** are one data type we use in programming.
